**Bullish**.\n\nThe reasons for this classification are:\n\n* The headlines feature several stocks that are performing well, such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Lucid (LCID), and Goldman Sachs (GS).\n* There are also several articles about companies posting strong earnings, such as Alphabet and Goldman Sachs.\n* The Dow Jones Index is also mentioned as soaring 500 points, which is a positive sign for the overall market.\n* The sentiment is overall optimistic, with many articles focusing on positive developments and strong performances.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there are also some bearish headlines, such as Tesla's (TSLA) quarterly revenue dropping 12% and Volvo's (VOLV) operating profit declining. But these negative headlines are not enough to outweigh the overall bullish sentiment of the news."}
